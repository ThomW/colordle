A simple daily game of Mastermind in the Wordle mold

## Objectives
I wanted to build a simple one-page Wordle clone, and decided to go back to one of the games that remind me most of Wordle - Mastermind and here we are.  

The entire application is in the index.html file with no dependencies on any other files or libraries, so it's super portable, but at the same time, super clunky.

I got the first working copy of this thing working in a couple hours, and spent another four tweaking and adding things like the colorblind mode.

## Future Plans
* Use localStorage to store game history
* Rewrite the layout to use CSS grids so the game scales better
* Create a Share feature like Wordle's
